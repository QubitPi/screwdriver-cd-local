This handy feature will bring up an entire Screwdriver instance (UI, API, and log store) locally for us to play with. 
All data written to a database will be stored in `data` directory.

Quickstart
----------

1. [Install Docker]
2. [Install Docker Compose][Docker Compose v2]
3. Run the command below in the terminal to bring up a Screwdriver cluster locally.

   ```bash
   docker pull node:18
   docker pull screwdrivercd/launcher
   docker pull buildpack-deps:22.04-scm

   git clone https://github.com/QubitPi/screwdriver-cd-local.git
   cd screwdriver-cd-local
   python3 setup.py
   ```

4. You will be prompted to enter your desired SCM provider as well as the Client ID and Client Secret. Afterwards, type
   `y` to launch Screwdriver!
